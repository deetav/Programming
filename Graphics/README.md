# Graphics.h 
Graphics programming in C used to drawing various geometrical shapes(rectangle, circle eclipse etc), use of mathematical function in drawing curves, coloring an object with different colors and patterns and simple animation programs like jumping ball and moving cars.

---
# Limitations
- incompetable with mac/linux based system
- high dependance on turbo c compiler
- not updated any more
- not open source
# Proposed Solution
- built a pythonic module to use instead of graphics.h
- multisystem module 
- only python installation is necessary
- open source so highly customisable
